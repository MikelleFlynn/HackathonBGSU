    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil.

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "The English walnut, Juglans regia, is a tree native to the region stretching from the Balkans to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of 100 feet, with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 11 to 23 leaflets, and the trees produce attractive, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit of the English walnut is a drupe, with a thick, leathery outer husk that encloses a smooth, hard shell containing the edible nut.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant. It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil.

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "The sweet cherry, Prunus avium, is a fruit-bearing tree that is native to Europe, western Asia, and northern Africa. It typically grows to a height of 15-30 feet, with a spread of 20-25 feet, and has a rounded crown. The leaves are oblong-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy dark green color. The flowers are white or pale pink, with five petals, and appear in clusters in the spring before the leaves. The fruit, which is the sweet cherry, is a small, round drupe, with a smooth, dark red or black skin and a juicy, sweet flesh.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, the sweet cherry prefers well-drained, fertile soil and full sun exposure.

    "description": "The peach, scientifically known as Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil.

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "The peach, scientifically known as Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "The English walnut, Juglans regia, is a tree native to the region stretching from the Balkans to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of 100 feet, with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 11 to 23 leaflets, and the trees produce attractive, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit of the English walnut is a drupe, with a thick, leathery outer husk that encloses a smooth, hard shell containing the edible nut.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant. It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking.

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "The peach, scientifically known as Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "The peach, scientifically known as Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "The English walnut, Juglans regia, is a tree native to the region stretching from the Balkans to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of 100 feet, with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 11 to 23 leaflets, and the trees produce attractive, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit of the English walnut is a drupe, with a thick, leathery outer husk that encloses a smooth, hard shell containing the edible nut.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant. It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops.

    "description": "The peach, scientifically known as Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "The English walnut, Juglans regia, is a tree native to the region stretching from the Balkans to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of 100 feet, with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 11 to 23 leaflets, and the trees produce attractive, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit of the English walnut is a drupe, with a thick, leathery outer husk that encloses a smooth, hard shell containing the edible nut.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant. It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "The peach, scientifically known as Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "The English walnut, Juglans regia, is a tree native to the region stretching from the Balkans to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of 100 feet, with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 11 to 23 leaflets, and the trees produce attractive, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit of the English walnut is a drupe, with a thick, leathery outer husk that encloses a smooth, hard shell containing the edible nut.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant. It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "The peach, scientifically known as Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "The English walnut, Juglans regia, is a tree native to the region stretching from the Balkans to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of 100 feet, with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 11 to 23 leaflets, and the trees produce attractive, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit of the English walnut is a drupe, with a thick, leathery outer husk that encloses a smooth, hard shell containing the edible nut.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant. It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "The peach, scientifically known as Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "The peach, scientifically known as Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "The peach, scientifically known as Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "The English walnut, Juglans regia, is a tree native to the region stretching from the Balkans to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of 100 feet, with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 11 to 23 leaflets, and the trees produce attractive, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit of the English walnut is a drupe, with a thick, leathery outer husk that encloses a smooth, hard shell containing the edible nut.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant. It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "The English walnut, Juglans regia, is a tree native to the region stretching from the Balkans to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of 100 feet, with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 11 to 23 leaflets, and the trees produce attractive, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit of the English walnut is a drupe, with a thick, leathery outer husk that encloses a smooth, hard shell containing the edible nut.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant. It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "The peach, scientifically known as Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "The English walnut, Juglans regia, is a tree native to the region stretching from the Balkans to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of 100 feet, with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 11 to 23 leaflets, and the trees produce attractive, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit of the English walnut is a drupe, with a thick, leathery outer husk that encloses a smooth, hard shell containing the edible nut.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant. It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses.

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "The English walnut, Juglans regia, is a tree native to the region stretching from the Balkans to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of 100 feet, with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 11 to 23 leaflets, and the trees produce attractive, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit of the English walnut is a drupe, with a thick, leathery outer husk that encloses a smooth, hard shell containing the edible nut.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant. It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "The peach, scientifically known as Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil.

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "The English walnut, Juglans regia, is a tree native to the region stretching from the Balkans to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of 100 feet, with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 11 to 23 leaflets, and the trees produce attractive, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit of the English walnut is a drupe, with a thick, leathery outer husk that encloses a smooth, hard shell containing the edible nut.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant. It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "The peach, scientifically known as Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "The English walnut, Juglans regia, is a tree native to the region stretching from the Balkans to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of 100 feet, with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 11 to 23 leaflets, and the trees produce attractive, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit of the English walnut is a drupe, with a thick, leathery outer husk that encloses a smooth, hard shell containing the edible nut.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant. It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "The peach, scientifically known as Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "The peach, scientifically known as Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "The English walnut, Juglans regia, is a tree native to the region stretching from the Balkans to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of 100 feet, with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 11 to 23 leaflets, and the trees produce attractive, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit of the English walnut is a drupe, with a thick, leathery outer husk that encloses a smooth, hard shell containing the edible nut.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant. It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "The English walnut, Juglans regia, is a tree native to the region stretching from the Balkans to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of 100 feet, with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 11 to 23 leaflets, and the trees produce attractive, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit of the English walnut is a drupe, with a thick, leathery outer husk that encloses a smooth, hard shell containing the edible nut.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant. It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "The peach, scientifically known as Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "The English walnut, Juglans regia, is a tree native to the region stretching from the Balkans to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of 100 feet, with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 11 to 23 leaflets, and the trees produce attractive, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit of the English walnut is a drupe, with a thick, leathery outer husk that encloses a smooth, hard shell containing the edible nut.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant. It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses.

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "The English walnut, Juglans regia, is a tree native to the region stretching from the Balkans to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of 100 feet, with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 11 to 23 leaflets, and the trees produce attractive, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit of the English walnut is a drupe, with a thick, leathery outer husk that encloses a smooth, hard shell containing the edible nut.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant. It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "The peach, scientifically known as Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil.

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "The English walnut, Juglans regia, is a tree native to the region stretching from the Balkans to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of 100 feet, with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 11 to 23 leaflets, and the trees produce attractive, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit of the English walnut is a drupe, with a thick, leathery outer husk that encloses a smooth, hard shell containing the edible nut.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant. It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "The peach, scientifically known as Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "The English walnut, Juglans regia, is a tree native to the region stretching from the Balkans to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of 100 feet, with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 11 to 23 leaflets, and the trees produce attractive, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit of the English walnut is a drupe, with a thick, leathery outer husk that encloses a smooth, hard shell containing the edible nut.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant. It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "The peach, scientifically known as Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "The peach, scientifically known as Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "The English walnut, Juglans regia, is a tree native to the region stretching from the Balkans to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of 100 feet, with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 11 to 23 leaflets, and the trees produce attractive, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit of the English walnut is a drupe, with a thick, leathery outer husk that encloses a smooth, hard shell containing the edible nut.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant. It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "The English walnut, Juglans regia, is a tree native to the region stretching from the Balkans to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of 100 feet, with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 11 to 23 leaflets, and the trees produce attractive, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit of the English walnut is a drupe, with a thick, leathery outer husk that encloses a smooth, hard shell containing the edible nut.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant. It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "The peach, scientifically known as Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "The English walnut, Juglans regia, is a tree native to the region stretching from the Balkans to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of 100 feet, with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 11 to 23 leaflets, and the trees produce attractive, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit of the English walnut is a drupe, with a thick, leathery outer husk that encloses a smooth, hard shell containing the edible nut.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant. It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses.

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "The English walnut, Juglans regia, is a tree native to the region stretching from the Balkans to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of 100 feet, with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 11 to 23 leaflets, and the trees produce attractive, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit of the English walnut is a drupe, with a thick, leathery outer husk that encloses a smooth, hard shell containing the edible nut.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant. It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "The peach, scientifically known as Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil.

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "The English walnut, Juglans regia, is a tree native to the region stretching from the Balkans to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of 100 feet, with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 11 to 23 leaflets, and the trees produce attractive, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit of the English walnut is a drupe, with a thick, leathery outer husk that encloses a smooth, hard shell containing the edible nut.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant. It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "The peach, scientifically known as Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "The English walnut, Juglans regia, is a tree native to the region stretching from the Balkans to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of 100 feet, with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 11 to 23 leaflets, and the trees produce attractive, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit of the English walnut is a drupe, with a thick, leathery outer husk that encloses a smooth, hard shell containing the edible nut.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant. It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "The peach, scientifically known as Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "The Red mulberry, Morus rubra, is native to the eastern United States and Canada. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of up to 80 feet. The leaves are dark green and have a rough texture. The tree produces small, greenish-white flowers in the spring, which develop into clusters of red berries in the summer.\r\n\r\nThe Red mulberry is often differentiated from other mulberry species by its smaller leaves and red berries. It prefers well-drained, moist soil and partial to full sun exposure. It is winter hardy and does not require any special care or maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe fruit of the Red mulberry is edible and can be eaten fresh or used in cooking and baking. The berries can be stored in the refrigerator for up to a week. The tree also has a number of medicinal uses, including as a laxative and for treating sore throat and bronchitis.\r\n\r\nIn terms of wildlife, the Red mulberry is a valuable food source for a variety of birds and mammals. Its fruit is a popular food source for birds such as robins, mockingbirds, and blue jays. The tree also provides habitat for birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Squash, also known as Cucurbita moschata, is a plant that is native to the Americas. It is commonly used in gardens and farms for its edible fruits and leaves.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can grow to be quite large, with some varieties reaching heights of up to 10 feet. They tend to grow quickly, with a mature plant producing fruit within a few months of planting.\r\n\r\nIn terms of growing conditions, squash plants prefer full sun and well-draining soil. They also need plenty of water, especially during the hot summer months. To cultivate squash successfully, a grower may need to provide adequate space for the plant to spread out, as well as support for the vines and fruit. Squash needs lots nutrition and therefore needs good soil. It can also be grown on compost\r\n\r\nThe edible parts of squash plants include the fruit and leaves. The fruit can be stored after harvest by keeping it in a cool, dry place. The leaves can also be eaten, either cooked or raw, and can be stored in the same way as the fruit.\r\n\r\nThe fruit can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and baked goods. The leaves can be used as a substitute for spinach in many recipes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its culinary uses, squash has a number of medicinal uses. The leaves have been used to treat a variety of ailments, including infections and inflammation.\r\n\r\nSquash plants can also be used for fertility, as the large leaves provide shade and moisture for the soil. They can also be used as mulch, wind protection, and ground cover.",

    "description": "Peas are a type of legume, native to western Asia and the Near East. They are an annual plant, meaning they grow, flower, and produce seeds within a single growing season. Peas have tendrils that allow them to climb, and their leaves are typically made up of two oblong leaflets and a tendril on a single petiole. Peas produce clusters of small, fragrant flowers that can be white, pink, or purple in color. The flowers give way to pod-like fruits that contain the peas.\r\n\r\nPeas are a cool-season crop, and prefer to grow in well-drained soil that is high in organic matter. They can tolerate some shade, but will produce the best yields when grown in full sun. Peas can be differentiated from similar plants by their tendrils and the clusters of small, fragrant flowers that they produce.\r\n\r\nPeas are a relatively small plant, typically growing to a height of one to two feet. They can be grown in rows or as a companion plant, and will typically take between 60 and 90 days to reach maturity. Peas are not winter hardy, and should be planted in the spring as soon as the soil can be worked.\r\n\r\nPeas are edible, and the seeds inside the pods can be eaten fresh or dried for storage. The leaves and stems of the pea plant can also be eaten, and are a good source of vitamins and minerals. Peas can be used in a variety of dishes, and are a common ingredient in soups, stews, and casseroles.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, peas are also valued for their ability to fix nitrogen in the soil. This makes them a valuable crop for improving soil fertility, and they are often grown as a cover crop or rotated with other crops to improve the overall health of the soil. Peas are also valued by wildlife, and their flowers and seeds are a favorite food for birds and other animals.",

    "description": "This entry describes all varieties of the common bean. This includes vining and bush/darf variaties and can have different names depending on their style of growths (see alternate names). These include the kidney bean, the navy bean, the pinto bean, the French bean and the wax bean\r\n\r\nThe common bean, scientific name Phaseolus vulgaris, is a herbaceous annual plant native to the Americas, specifically the regions extending from the southwestern United States to South America. It is a member of the Fabaceae (legume) family.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has a range of different appearances, depending on the variety. Most varieties have a simple, erect stem that grows to a height of 20-60 cm. The leaves are typically green and consist of 3-5 oblong leaflets. The flowers are small and white, pink, or purple in color. The fruit is a legume, which contains the seeds.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is typically a small plant, but some varieties can grow to be quite large, reaching heights of up to 2 meters. The plant grows relatively quickly, with the growing season typically lasting between 60-100 days.\r\n\r\nThe common bean prefers well-drained soil and full sun, but can also grow in partial shade. It is sensitive to frost and should be planted after the last frost date in the spring. To cultivate the common bean successfully, a grower may need to ensure that the soil is adequately fertilized and provide support for the plant to climb, if necessary.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is edible, with the seeds and the young pods being the most commonly consumed parts. The seeds can be cooked and eaten as a protein-rich vegetable, and the young pods can be eaten as a green vegetable. The edible parts can be stored after harvest by drying the seeds or by preserving the young pods in vinegar or oil.\r\n\r\nThe common bean has many uses beyond being a food source. The plant can fix nitrogen in the soil, improving its fertility and making it a useful companion plant for other crops. The dried leaves and stems of the common bean can be used as mulch or as a source of organic matter. In some cultures, the fibers from the stems are used to make ropes or other weaving materials. Additionally, the plant has been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments.\r\n\r\nThe common bean is also valuable for wildlife. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the plant provides food for a variety of insects, birds, and small mammals.\r\n\r\n### Links \r\n[Beans Seed Starting Tips @ Harvest to Table](https://harvesttotable.com/beans-seed-starting-tips/)\r\n\r\n\r\n### Propagation - direct sow\r\n\r\nDirect-sow beans in spring after all danger of frost has passed and soil is at least 16Â°C (60Â°F). In warm-winter regions, sow beans in late summer for harvest in winter. Time sowing so that beans come to harvest before the first frost.",

    "description": "The peach, scientifically known as Prunus persica, is a deciduous tree native to northwest China. It typically grows to be about 10-30 feet tall, with a short trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are oval-shaped, with serrated edges and a glossy, dark green color. The flowers are pink and white, with five petals each.\r\n\r\nPeaches are known for their fuzzy, peach-colored skin and juicy, sweet flesh. They can be eaten fresh, canned, or cooked into dishes such as pies and cobblers. The edible parts of the peach include the flesh and the seed, which contains a small kernel that can be ground into flour. Peaches can be stored after harvest by keeping them in a cool, dry place.\r\n\r\nPeaches prefer well-draining, loamy soil and full sun. They can be grown in a variety of climates, but do best in warm, temperate regions. To cultivate peaches successfully, growers may need to provide support for the trees, prune them regularly, and protect them from pests and diseases. Peaches are generally winter hardy, but can be damaged by frost.\r\n\r\nIn addition to being eaten fresh, peaches have a variety of uses. The flowers can be used in herbal teas, and the leaves can be used to make a yellow dye. The wood of the tree can be used for smoking meat, and the kernels can be used to make oil. Peaches are also a valuable food source for wildlife, attracting birds, squirrels, and other animals.",

    "description": "Sage is a perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. It has woody stems with gray-green leaves that are typically 2-4 inches long and have a soft, velvety texture. The flowers of sage are small and typically blue or purple, although they can also be white or pink. Sage grows to a height of about 2-3 feet and has a spreading habit.\r\n\r\nSage prefers well-drained, sandy soil and full sun, and is drought-tolerant once established. It is winter hardy in most climates, but may need to be protected in very cold regions. To cultivate sage successfully, it is important to prune the plant regularly to promote new growth and prevent the plant from becoming woody.\r\n\r\nThe leaves of sage are edible and have a strong, savory flavor. They can be used fresh or dried and are often used in dishes such as stuffings, sausages, and marinades. The leaves can also be stored for later use by drying them and storing them in an airtight container.\r\n\r\nSage has a number of uses beyond its culinary value. It has traditionally been used for its medicinal properties, and is said to have antibacterial and anti-inflammatory effects. It is also often used as a fertility herb and is said to promote lactation in nursing mothers. Sage can also be used as a natural insect repellent and as a mulch to suppress weeds.\r\n\r\nSage is valued by wildlife for its nectar, which attracts bees and other pollinators. It is also an important host plant for the larvae of several species of butterflies and moths. In addition, the leaves of sage can be used as a natural insecticide to control aphids and other garden pests.\r\n\r\nIn humid zones above 9 it might be only possible to grow as an annual.",

    "description": "The Jerusalem artichoke (Helianthus tuberosus), also knows as \"sunchoke\", is a species of sunflower native to the central and eastern United States and eastern Canada. It is a tall, herbaceous plant with yellow flowers and a rough, hairy stem. The plant can grow up to 4-10 feet in height, and its leaves are broad and coarse, with toothed edges. The edible tubers, which are produced in the ground, are similar in appearance to ginger root, with a slightly bumpy, brown skin and a white or pale yellow flesh.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes prefer well-draining, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. They are hardy in cold climates and can be grown throughout most of the United States and Canada. To cultivate the plant successfully, gardeners and farmers may need to water regularly and provide support for the tall stems. The tubers can be harvested in the fall, after the plant has died back, and can be stored in a cool, dry place for several months. Be conscious of where you plant it, because removal is next to impossible. If even a small section of rhizome is left in the ground, it will grow into a whole new plant.\r\n\r\nJerusalem artichokes are edible and can be eaten raw, cooked, or roasted. The tubers have a sweet, nutty flavor and can be used in a variety of dishes, including soups, stews, and salads. They are also a good source of fiber and contain a high amount of inulin, a type of carbohydrate that is beneficial for maintaining healthy gut bacteria. The tubers are a good replacement diet for the potato for people with diabetes.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, Jerusalem artichokes can also provide a number of other benefits to gardeners and farmers. The plant is an excellent source of nectar for bees and other pollinators, and its rough, hairy stems can provide shelter and nesting sites for birds and other wildlife.\r\n\r\n# Propagation\r\n\r\nWhile growing from seed is possible, it is much harder and yields happen to be smaller.",

    "description": "Beech is a tree that is native to Europe, Western Asia, and North America. It is known for its smooth, gray bark and its elliptical leaves, which are dark green and glossy on the upper side and pale and hairy on the underside. In the spring, the tree produces small, yellow-green flowers that are pollinated by the wind. In the fall, the leaves turn golden yellow before falling off.\r\n\r\nBeech trees can grow to be very large, with some specimens reaching over 100 feet tall. They grow relatively slowly, taking several decades to reach their full size. Beech trees can be differentiated from similar species by their smooth bark and elliptical leaves.\r\n\r\nBeech trees prefer well-drained, moist soil and full sun, but they can tolerate partial shade. To cultivate beech trees successfully, a grower may need to provide regular watering and mulching, as well as pruning to maintain the tree's shape. Beech trees are winter hardy and can withstand cold temperatures.\r\n\r\nBeech trees are not typically grown for their edible parts. However, young leaves and the nuts that the tree produces are edible and can be roasted and eaten. The nuts can also be stored for later use.\r\n\r\nBeech trees have several uses beyond their ornamental value. The wood is strong and durable, and is often used in furniture and flooring. Beech leaves can be used as mulch, and the tree's root system can help to stabilize soil and prevent erosion. Beech trees also provide habitat and food for a variety of wildlife, including birds and small mammals.",

    "description": "Black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia) is a fast-growing tree that is native to the eastern United States. It is a member of the pea family, Fabaceae, and is known for its fragrant, white flowers and dark, hardwood timber.\r\n\r\nBlack locust trees can grow to a height of 80-100 feet and have a straight, upright growth habit. The bark is dark and furrowed, and the leaves are compound, with 7-19 oval-shaped leaflets arranged along a central stem. The flowers are fragrant and bloom in clusters in the spring, and are followed by long, slender seed pods that contain small, brown seeds.\r\n\r\nTo grow black locust successfully, it is important to choose a location with well-drained, fertile soil and full sun. The tree is adaptable and can grow in a variety of soil types, but prefers moist conditions and does not tolerate drought well. Black locust can also be grown in containers, but will need to be repotted regularly to accommodate its rapid growth.\r\n\r\nBlack locust wood is strong and durable, and is often used for fence posts, poles, and other construction purposes. The bark, leaves, and flowers can also be used for a variety of purposes. The bark can be used to make a yellow dye, and the leaves and flowers can be used as a natural insect repellent. The flowers are also edible, and can be used to make a sweet, fragrant tea.\r\n\r\nBlack locust is also a valuable food source for wildlife, including birds, deer, and small mammals. The flowers attract bees and other pollinators, and the seeds are eaten by birds and other animals.\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that, while black locust is generally safe to handle and consume, the plant contains toxic compounds that can cause irritation and allergic reactions in some people. Additionally, black locust is considered invasive in some areas, and can spread rapidly if not controlled.",

    "description": "Black walnut is a large deciduous tree native to North America, growing up to 100 feet tall. It has a straight trunk with a rough, deeply furrowed bark, and a canopy of large, pinnately compound leaves with 15-23 lance-shaped leaflets. The tree produces large, greenish-white flowers in the spring, followed by large, spherical fruits containing a single, edible nut.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are prized for their distinctive, rich flavor and are commonly used in baking and cooking. The nuts can be harvested in the fall and can be stored in their shells for several months.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts prefer deep, well-drained soils and can tolerate a wide range of soil pH levels. They can be grown successfully in full sun to partial shade, and they are relatively drought-tolerant once established. Black walnuts are not particularly winter hardy, and they can be damaged by heavy ice and snow.\r\n\r\nIn addition to their culinary uses, black walnuts have a number of other uses. The wood is highly prized for its durability and attractive grain, and is used in furniture making and other woodworking applications. The tree's leaves, bark, and nuts are also used in herbal medicine for their astringent and tonic properties. Black walnuts are also valued for their ability to improve soil health, as their deep taproots help to break up compacted soils and their fallen leaves add organic matter to the soil.\r\n\r\nBlack walnuts are also an important food source for wildlife, including squirrels, birds, and deer. The tree provides shelter and nesting sites for a variety of animals, and its fallen leaves and nuts provide food for many species.",

    "description": "The English walnut, Juglans regia, is a tree native to the region stretching from the Balkans to the Himalayas. It is a deciduous tree that can grow to a height of 100 feet, with a straight, cylindrical trunk and a rounded crown. The leaves are compound, with 11 to 23 leaflets, and the trees produce attractive, fragrant yellow flowers in the spring. The fruit of the English walnut is a drupe, with a thick, leathery outer husk that encloses a smooth, hard shell containing the edible nut.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut prefers well-drained soils and full sun, and is relatively drought-tolerant. It can be grown in a variety of climates, including temperate, subtropical, and Mediterranean, but it may not be winter-hardy in areas with severe cold. To cultivate the tree successfully, a grower will need to provide proper irrigation and pruning, and protect the young trees from pests and diseases.\r\n\r\nThe nuts of the English walnut are edible and highly nutritious, containing high levels of protein, fiber, and healthy fats. They can be eaten fresh, or they can be stored by drying or freezing. The nuts can also be used to make a variety of dishes, including spreads, cookies, and cakes. In addition to their culinary uses, the nuts of the English walnut have been used medicinally to treat a variety of ailments, including headaches and skin conditions.\r\n\r\nThe English walnut is also valued for its wood, which is hard, strong, and durable. It is used to make a variety of products, including furniture, cabinetry, and gunstocks. The tree also provides habitat and food for a wide range of wildlife, including birds, squirrels, and other animals.",
