      <h1 class="header">Why is Gardening Imporant?</h1>
      <h3 class="desc">Gardening is important for a variety of reasons. It promotes environmental sustainability by encouraging the growth of plants that can improve air quality, support biodiversity, and reduce carbon footprints. Gardening also provides access to fresh, nutritious food, fostering healthier eating habits and reducing reliance on store-bought produce. It can be a stress-reliever, offering a peaceful, rewarding activity that connects people with nature and promotes mental well-being. Additionally, gardening helps conserve water, improve soil health, and encourages biodiversity, contributing to the overall health of the ecosystem.</h2>
